Set up Flutter SDK for GitHub Actions.

* **Pure TypeScript** — No external tools. Consistent behavior across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
* **SHA-256 verification** — Every downloaded archive is verified against the official manifest to detect tampering.
* **Reliable downloads** — Automatic retry (3 attempts with jitter) and socket/idle timeouts for both HTTP downloads and git operations.
* **Automated maintenance** — Dependencies are kept up to date via Dependabot with auto-merge enabled for patch and minor updates.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml) for the full list of inputs and outputs.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2
  - uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  - run: flutter --version
```

Zero configuration installs the latest stable Flutter SDK with caching enabled.

> **Note:** The examples in this README pin a specific version. Always check the [latest release](https://github.com/koji-1009/setup-flutter/releases/latest) for the most recent version. Tools like [pinact](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/pinact) or [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-dependabot) can keep your workflow files up to date automatically.

### Specify version

```yaml
- uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  with:
    flutter-version: '3.41.0'
```

Supports exact versions, ranges (`3.x`, `3.41.x`), and constraints (`>=3.41.0 <4.0.0`).

### Channel

```yaml
- uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  with:
    channel: beta
```

### Version file

```yaml
# From pubspec.yaml sdk constraint
- uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  with:
    flutter-version-file: pubspec.yaml

# From .fvmrc
- uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  with:
    flutter-version-file: .fvmrc
```

### FVM flavors

```yaml
- uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  with:
    flutter-version-file: .fvmrc
    fvm-flavor: production
```

### Architecture

```yaml
- uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  with:
    architecture: arm64
```

Auto-detected if omitted. Supported values: `x64`, `arm64`.

### Matrix testing

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    channel: [stable, beta]
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2
  - uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
    with:
      channel: ${{ matrix.channel }}
  - run: flutter test
```

### Caching

SDK and pub caches are enabled by default. To disable:

```yaml
- uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  with:
    cache-sdk: false
    cache-pub: false
```

Pub caching requires `pubspec.lock` in the working directory.

### Dry run

Resolve version without installing. Useful for checking available versions in CI.

```yaml
- uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  id: flutter
  with:
    flutter-version: '3.x'
    dry-run: true
- run: echo "${{ steps.flutter.outputs.flutter-version }}"
```

### Git source

Install from a git repository instead of release archives:

```yaml
# master branch
- uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  with:
    git-source: git
    channel: master

# Custom fork
- uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  with:
    git-source: git
    git-source-url: https://github.com/user/flutter-fork.git
    flutter-version: my-branch

# Skip flutter precache for CI jobs that target specific platforms
- uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
  with:
    git-source: git
    git-source-precache: false
```

> **Note:** Specifying a commit hash as `flutter-version` with `git-source: git` requires a full clone (no `--depth 1`), which is slower. When using git source, `dart-version` output is `unknown` since it is not available from the git metadata.

### China mirror

```yaml
env:
  FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL: https://storage.flutter-io.cn
steps:
  - uses: koji-1009/setup-flutter@f3f6da93828bdc04c16df16e88984a1bd8f3ce81 # v1.1.3
```

## Outputs
